# üç† Potato Disease Classification using CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify potato leaf images into three categories:

- **Potato___Early_blight**  
- **Potato___Late_blight**  
- **Potato___healthy**

The dataset is organized into **Train**, **Validation**, and **Test** folders. The model is trained from scratch with data augmentation, and it achieves high accuracy in detecting potato diseases.
